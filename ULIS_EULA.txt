If You reside in the European Union, act for non-commercial purposes and terminate your Subscription within fourteen (14) days of payment to Praxinos, and provided that You have not yet downloaded the Source Codes, Praxinos will refund You the full amount You paid in connection with said terminated Subscription.

Article 6. General Restrictions

The rights granted by Praxinos under a Standard License or an Extended License do not permit You to:
    • Use the Source Codes for defamatory purposes or any illegal manner whatsoever
    • Use the Source Codes in a way that allows others to download, extract or redistribute the Source Codes as a stand-alone file (i.e., only the Source Codes themselves, separate from the project or end use);
    • To declare that You are the original creator of a work composed largely of licensed Source Codes. Thus, You may not create works based solely on licensed Source Codes and declare that You are the author;
    • To use the Source Codes (in whole or in part) and/or to register and/or attempt to register the Source Codes as an innovative element of an underlying patentable process and/or as an innovative element that can be appropriated by a patent title (in any country). In addition, You are not entitled to register (in any jurisdiction whatsoever) the Source Codes (in whole or in part) with a body authorized to receive the deposit of source codes (i.e. Agency for the Protection of Programs (APP) in France);
    • To use the Source Codes (including caption information, keywords or other metadata associated with said Source Codes) for machine learning and/or artificial intelligence purposes, or for any technology designed or intended for the identification of individuals, unless expressly authorized by Praxinos;
    • Use the caption information, keywords, accompanying text or other metadata associated with the Source Codes separately and independently of the Source Codes, nor allow third parties to access or use this information associated with the Source Codes, unless expressly authorized by Praxinos;


Article 7. Authorized persons

	7.1. The rights granted to You under a Standard License or an Extended License are non-transferable and therefore cannot be sub-licensed. These rights may not be transferred to third parties.
	
	7.2. However, in cases where You are acting on behalf of your employer or a legal entity (legal person), the latter may use the Source Codes under license. In such case, You represent and warrant that You have the ability to bind your employer/legal entity under this EULA. Otherwise, your employer/legal entity will not be able to use the said Source Codes.

The Rights may only be granted to You or your employer (or legal entity), but not both, according to the Licensee designated at the time of Subscription. 

In addition, You may authorize subcontractors or distributors to use the Source Codes in any production or distribution process related to your final project. However, such subcontractors agree to abide by the terms of this EULA. As such, You are responsible for the proper execution of the EULA by your authorized subcontractors and will remain fully liable to Praxinos in the event of non-compliance. 

	7.3. With respect to the Extended License:
Pursuant to Section 5.3. of this EULA, only a specified number of authorized persons may use the Source Codes.

An increase in the number of authorized persons may be requested from Praxinos by any written means and would give rise to an additional charge and a modification of this EULA by way of an amendment. 

Article 8. Properties – Attribution

	8.1. The Source Codes granted under Standard License or Extended License are the property of Praxinos and its partners (developers). As such, all rights not expressly granted by this EULA are retained by Praxinos and its partners.

	8.2. In cases of use of Source Codes under a Standard License, You are required to include a credit to Praxinos in a reasonable size and in a reasonably visible location. In cases of use of Source Codes under an Extended License, You are not required to include a credit to Praxinos.

	8.3. You are authorized to use the name "Praxinos" for the sole purpose of attribution under the conditions set forth above. Consequently, You may in no case use the distinctive signs belonging to Praxinos (names, brands, logos...) without its prior written authorization.

Article 9. “Open-source” licenses

Certain Source Codes may, in whole or in part, be part of so-called "free" or "open-source" licenses ("Open Source Codes"). These open-source elements are defined as elements distributed with all of its source programs, so that all users who use it can enrich it and redistribute it in turn. 

As such, it means that the owners of said open-source programs and Open-Source Codes have chosen to grant users rights such as the right to copy, modify and redistribute the Open-Source Codes. The extent of the rights granted to users is determined within more or less permissive license types.  NB: So-called "free" and “open-source” licenses are not necessarily synonymous with free-of-charge technologies.

Examples of "free" or "open-source" licenses can be found below:  
    • The MIT License: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
    • The FTL License :https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs/FTL.TXT 
    • The Apache 2.0 License: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

The Open-Source Codes belong to third parties and are not governed by the terms of this EULA, but by the terms of the license type associated with them. It is thus up to You to consult the said licenses type to know the contents and the extent of the rights granted to You on the Open-Source Codes.

Nothing in this EULA limits your rights or grants You any rights that replace the terms of the license type associated with the Open-Source Codes.

Article 10. Termination
