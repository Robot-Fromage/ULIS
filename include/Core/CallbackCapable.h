/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// @class      TCallbackCapable
/// @brief      The TCallbackCapable class provides a base abstract interface
///             to enable callback capability on PIC classes.
/// @details    Why is TCallbackCapable implemented as a class designed to be
///             inherited from:
///
///             The other solution is to make it a member of the classes that
///             need a delegate, this may seem simpler, but then it requires
///             more code to be able to change the delegate during the object
///             lifetime. This way, the object inherits the SetDelegate method.
///             You can still have more than one delegate, you just need to
///             inherit multiple times from the TCallbackCapable with a
///             different DelegateType. ( Although, most client want to inherit
///             TCallbackCapable privately.
///
///             In case you need multiple delegates of the same type, it is
///             forbidden to inherit directly multiple time from the same base.
///             So that's why the _ID arg is provided, it differentiates the
///             bases artificially and allows to have multiple same delegates
///             for different purposes.
///
///             For simplicity, a macro is provided below, see:
///                 - ULIS_DECLARE_SIMPLE_DELEGATE
///                 - ULIS_DECLARE_SIMPLE_DELEGATE_SPEC
///
///             it provides default template instanciation and export, as well
///             as a typedef such as "FOnValueChanged", which is intented to
///             be the main alias used to acces the TCallbackCapable part of
///             the PIC that uses it. In case of multiple TCallbackCapable,
///             Invoke() calls will be ambiguous and need to be prefixed by
///             the alias:: identifier.
///
///             No automatic wrappers are provided to automate callback calls,
///             because it is not possible to know in advance which delegate
///             must be called, or if it is necessary in all methods ( such as
///             getters ), and it would also be problematic in const methods.
///
///             TCallbackCapable is not supposed to be instanciated, but it's
///             still possible to do so if you want to chose to use it by
///             composition instead of inheritance, and for simplicity the
///             typedefed TCallbackCapable can be used directly as input
///             parameter in client classes and needs to be able to be default-
///             constructed as a default input parameter, which requires it to
///             be instanciable in global scope.
