/// @class      FFixedAllocArena
/// @brief      The FFixedAllocArena class is a class that provides a single
///             configurable Arena buffer that manages allocations of fixed
///             size. It is meant to be used for tiles or any objects of fixed
///             size.
/// @details    FFixedAllocArena allocs fixed allocations inside its block, and
///             returns "clients" to the allocation, that is, a pointer to an
///             allocation.
///             Using such clients allows us to regularly defragment the Arena,
///             or multiple Arenas if used in a pool, without losing the data
///             if moved to another memory sector.
///
///             The Arena block allocates extra bytes to store some information
///             about the memory status and allocation status, to ensure a fixed
///             number of fixed allocations cells are available.
///
///             The layout of the buffer is like so:
///             - [meta][data]
///             - [data] contains the real data used by the allocation or tile.
///             - [meta] stores meta information about the allocation such as [client]:
///                 - [client] is a pointer to the allocation, that allows tracking a moving alloc in case of a defrag
///
///             FFixedAllocArena has public methods to estimate the local
///             fragmentation of the memory. To be precise, there is no issue
///             with fragmentation within a single Arena, but it is still possible
///             to measure the sparsity of the allocations. Fragmentation
///             becomes a problem when many arenas are sparse, hence wasting a
///             lot of space.
///
///             A bit of Terminology:
///             - byte_t,     a size in bytes
///             - tByte,      a byte value ( uint8 )
///             - tAlloc,     an allocation ( uint8* )
///             - Arena,      the whole system
///             - block,      the underlying page buffer
///             - metaBase,   the meta info before an alloc
///             - client,     a pointer to an alloc that can change position
///             - cell,       a fixed element in the area that can host an alloc
///             - chunk,      a collection of cells, either free or used
