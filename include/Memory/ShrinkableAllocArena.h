/// @class      FShrinkableAllocArena
/// @brief      The FShrinkableAllocArena provides a  configurable Arena buffer that manages
///             allocations with a maximal size, that can shrink over time.
///             It is meant to be used for RLE tiles or any objects with a known maximal size
///             that can shrink. It is perfect for RLE because we know the max size of an
///             incompressible tile, but we don't know the min size until the compression is done.
///             A collection of such shrinkable allocs is subject to a high fragmentation rate.
/// @details    FShrinkableAllocArena allocs initially fixed max size allocations inside its block,
///             and returns "clients" to the allocation, that is, a pointer to an
///             allocation.
///             Using such clients allows us to regularly defragment the Arena,
///             or multiple Arenas if used in a pool, without losing the data
///             if moved to another memory sector.
///
///             The Arena block allocates extra bytes to store some information
///             about the memory status and allocation status, to ensure a fixed
///             number of fixed allocations cells are available.
///
///             The layout of the buffer is defined as follows:
///             - [meta][data]
///             - [data] contains the real data used by the allocation or tile.
///             - [meta] stores meta information about the allocation such as [client][prev][next]:
///                 - [client] is a pointer to the allocation, that allows tracking a moving alloc in case of a defrag
///                 - [prev] is a delta in bytes to the prev metabase
///                 - [next] is a delta in bytes to the next metabase
///             The very first element of the buffer should have a prev delta of zero, it acts as a sentinel.
///             We also need a way to identify the case when we reach the end of the arena, so we add another sentinel at the end
///             with a next meta size of 0. No other allocation can have a next meta size of 0.
///
///             FShrinkableAllocArena has public methods to estimate the local
///             fragmentation of the memory. Fragmentation matters here in an arena with
///             variable size even within a single Arena. The method used to determine
///             fragmentation is arbitrary but serves the purpose of estimating when a
///             defragmentation pass is necessary. It is not as straightforward as for
///             fixed allocations.
///
///             A bit of Terminology:
///             - byte_t,     a size in bytes
///             - tByte,      a byte value ( uint8 )
///             - tAlloc,     an allocation ( uint8* )
///             - Arena,      the whole system
///             - block,      the underlying page buffer
///             - metaBase,   the meta info before an alloc
///             - client,     a pointer to an alloc that can change position
///             - cell,       a fixed element in the area that can host an alloc
///             - chunk,      a collection of cells, either free or used
