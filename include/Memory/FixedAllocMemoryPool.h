/// @class      FFixedAllocMemoryPool
/// @brief      The FFixedAllocMemoryPool class is a class that provides a
///             configurable pool of fixed alloc arenas buffer to manages
///             allocations of fixed size data efficiently and optimize memory
///             consumption by evaluating sparsity, occupation and fragmentation
///             of the various arena pages and concatenate them if neccessary.
///             It is meant to be used for tiles or any objects of fixed
///             size, and can be driven asynchronously by a larger system if
///             necessary.
/// @details    FFixedAllocMemoryPool allows to obtain fixed allocations inside that
///             are resident of one arena page underlying block. It returns  "clients"
///             of the allocation, that is, a pointer to an allocation.
///             The API is mostly similar to FFixedAllocArena, but the pool aggregates
///             them in a list and manages fragmentation and higher level systems and
///             algorithms to drive them efficiently.

        Make sure all allocations are free before destroying a pool, or it will trigger an assert in debug builds.
        You can use UnsafeFreeAll() before destruction to ensure it doesn't crash, but only if you know what you're doing.
        It is possible to do so before program termination, but if clients don't expect this, they will all be deleted
        without notification and induce a corrupted state within the program.
