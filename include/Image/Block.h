/// @class      FBlock
/// @brief      The FBlock class provides a mean of storing and manipulating
///             digital images in various formats, with direct access to pixel
///             data.
/// @details    FBlock is the primary class to use when manipulating images
///             with ULIS.
///
///             The block has a format which specifies the type, memory layout,
///             color model, and other informations about the image.
///             The underlying data is always a regular contiguous buffer
///             storage that lives on RAM with no alignment requirement.
///
///             The FBlock class is very lightweight, the memory load is in the
///             data it points to, and the class never performs any kind of
///             heavy operations. It does not communicate with the GPU or use
///             any kind of hardware accelerated feature just by itself.
///
///             Copy, wether deep or shallow, is explicitly forbidden, If you
///             need to copy image data, you can use the explicit Copy or XCopy
///             functions that ULIS provides.
///
///             FBlock supports loading an external data pointer and
///             treat it as its own storage: this is useful for sharing memory
///             without having to copy it and you can grab or release ownership
///             at any time with the help of the cleanup callbacks, just make
///             sure to use the proper deallocator when providing external data
///             which was allocated with a custom allocator. However the data
///             is not reference counted.
///
///             You can also provide custom callbacks to signal when the block
///             is dirty, for example use it to upload a small rect of the
///             image to a GPU texture when triggered.
///
///             It is perfectly fine to create FBlock objects on the stack:
///             \snippet data/block_snippet.h FBlock on stack
///             But you can also allocate blocks dynamically:
///             \snippet data/block_snippet.h FBlock on heap
