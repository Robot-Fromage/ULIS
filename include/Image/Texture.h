/// @class      FTexture
/// @brief      The FTexture class provides a mean of storing and manipulating
///             digital images on the GPU in various formats.
/// @details    FTexture is the way to manipulate images on GPU with ULIS.
///
///             The texture has a format which specifies the type, memory layout,
///             color model, and other informations about the image.
///             The underlying data is dependant on the GPU backend, but is most
///             likely stored in GPU VRAM.
///
///             The FTexture class is very lightweight, the memory load is in the
///             data it points to in the VRAM, and the class never performs any
///             kind of heavy operations. It differs from FBlock because of that.
///
///             Copy, wether deep or shallow, is explicitely forbidden, If you
///             need to copy image data, you can use the explicit Copy functions
///             that ULIS provides.
///
///             FTexture objects can be edited using an FContext instance, it
///             also supports uploading a of an FBlock into its bulk.
///             FTexture API does not allow implicit or explicit sharing of the
///             underlying data accross multiples instances.
///
///             You can also provide custom callbacks to signal when the texture
///             is dirty, for example use it to download a small rect of the
///             image to a CPU texture when triggered.
///
///             It is perfectly fine to create FTexture objects on the stack,
///             But you can also allocate textures dynamically.
