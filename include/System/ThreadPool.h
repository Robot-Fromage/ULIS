/// @class      FThreadPool
/// @brief      The FThreadPool class provides a way to hold a thread pool with
///             several threads running and waiting for commands, with no overhead
///             related to thread launching and joining.
/// @details    The FThreadPool holds a certain number of threads which actual
///             implementation is irrelevant ( wether the backend is Posix threads,
///             Intel TBB, or no thread support at all ). If the system doesn't
///             support multithreading, the FThreadPool emulates a multithreaded
///             behaviour anyway with no change to application logic, but it
///             processes it in a linear monothreaded fashion.
///
