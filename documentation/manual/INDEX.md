## Overview
Welcome to the official ULIS documentation.  
ULIS ( Utility Library for Imaging Systems ) is a library written in C++, it is aimed at software rasterization and digital image processing. The library is young and development is ongoing, but it is already powerful enough to power softwares used in the real world such as ILIAD, and to compete with other image processing libraries. The goal of ULIS is to provide a single dependency for applications with interactive drawing capabilities and performance in mind. It features a lot of classical image processing algorithms, as well as an advanced asynchronous programming model. All features are designed to take advantage of parallelism on multicore systems, and use the latest available SIMD instructions sets whenever available ( AVX2, SSE4.2 ). ULIS also strives to stay a small dependency with small binary size, that is easy to build and integrate into other projects with CMake.
