# Global Overview
Global overview of the various features of ULIS.

## Data
A non-exhaustive list of important data elements in ULIS:
    - FBlock, a simple 2D image, also called a pixel matrix, the underlying storage is a simple contiguous buffer with enough storage to contain pixel data according to the specified width, height, and depth, can embed a colorspace.
    - FPixel, a simple wrapper around a pointer to a pixel in a FBlock, with utilities to access channels values and format informations, can embed a colorspace.
    - FColor, a light allocation storing channels values and format informations in a given format, according to a configured color model and channel depth, can embed a colorspace.
    - FMat3F, a simple 3x3 Matrix of floats used to represent either affine transforms or homographies 
    - FRectI, a simple AABB rectangle with integer coordinates often used to represent regions in a FBlock. See also FRectF for rectangles with floating point coordinates.
    - FVec2I, a simple vector with integer coordinates, often used to represent a point or a vector in a FBlock. See also FVec2F for the floating point counterpart.
    - FContext, an heavy object that you generally want to create only once, featuring a runtime dispatch mechanism that selects the best implementation of the various block processing features available, according to a given format, selecting SIMD specializations or format-specific specializations when available, with a systelatic generic fallback if not available.
    - FFont, a font object representing a font entry in a font family, such as "Arial Black". Not bound to a specific size. Can be used to raster text in a FBlock through FContext.
    - FGradient, a gradient object used to raster gradients in a FBlock through a FContext.
    - FPathInfo, a utility class with static methods to retrieve informations about system paths.
    - FCPUInfo, a utility class with static methods to retrieve informations about the running hardware.
    - FLibInfo, a utility class with static methods to retrieve informations about the library, and the features of the machine it was compiled on.
    - FString, a string class for use in ULIS.
    - TArray, a dynamic array or vector class for use in ULIS.

## Features

## Examples
There is a large amount of example projects available in the ULIS repository that can be generated with cmake if ULIS_BUILD_EXAMPLES is enabled during generation. Some of them have a lot of extensive explanatory comments, some of them are less verbose. They all showcase one or more features and how to use it. They are a good way to grasp the philosophy and recurrent patterns that come into play when using ULIS. Some of them might not compile at all times and need a little refactor, but these changes are often minimal. Here is a non-exhaustive list, source files for these projects can be found under ULIS/example:
